[ux] Rate limit tooltip message confusing - users unsure if "Rate Limited" means current status or plan type (<120 chars)
[design] "Unlimited Requests | Rate Limited" messaging ambiguous - should clarify plan type vs current status
[user-feedback] GitHub feedback: "Does it mean I am being Rate Limited right now, or I am on the Rate Limit Plan?"
[error-fix] Changed "Rate Limited" to "Pro Plan" and improved explanatory text to clarify plan type vs status
[optimization] Replaced second line with info icon hover - cleaner UI while preserving information accessibility
[design] Removed redundant "Pro Plan" text since plan type already shown in user info section
