[ux] "Rate Limited" status vs plan type confusion - users unsure of current state vs plan capability
[user-feedback] GitHub: "Does it mean I am being Rate Limited right now, or I am on the Rate Limit Plan?"
[error-fix] Changed "Rate Limited" â†’ info icon hover with explanatory text
[design] Removed redundant plan type display (already in user info section)
[best-practice] UI messaging: avoid ambiguous terms, use progressive disclosure, eliminate redundancy
