* New Unlimited With Rate Limits Pricing Model

** Introduction

Cursor's new Ultra plan and the *"unlimited-with-rate-limits"* model rolled out on 17–18 June 2025.

** Official Information

*** Ultra Plan Launch (17 June 2025)
- $200/month plan with "20x more usage than Pro" with unlimited requests, much higher rate limits.
- Pro keeps $20 price but moves to unlimited-with-rate-limits scheme
- Legacy 500-fast-request users can opt out in ~Cursor Dashboard~ > ~Advanced Settings~
- See: [[#ref1][Cursor Ultra announcement]]

*** Rate-Limits Documentation (updated 18 June 2025)
- Two buckets per user: *burst* (for spiky activity, slow to refill) and *local* (refills every few hours)
- Limits based on total compute (model, prompt length, files attached, etc.), not simple request counter
- Exact numbers withheld "to avoid abuse"
- When both buckets empty, users can:
  1. Wait for refill
  2. Switch to cheaper model
  3. Turn on usage-based billing
  4. Upgrade to Ultra (≈20x bigger buckets)
- See: [[#ref2][Rate-limits documentation]]

*** Forum Moderator & Staff Clarifications (18 June 2025)
- Ultra *includes* Max mode
- New plans have *no automatic fall-back to slow queue*
- Once 429 appears, user is rate-limited until refill or manual toggle of usage billing
- Ultra has "20x the rate limits of Pro" but exact numbers are not published
- See: [[#ref3][Forum clarifications]]

** Common Misconception: The "500 vs 10,000" Request Numbers

*Short answer*: Nobody at Cursor has published the exact figures "Pro ≈ 500 fast requests, Ultra ≈ 10,000."

*** What Cursor Actually Commits To
- *Legacy system*: Pro included *500 fast requests* per user per month (see [[#ref8][Plans & Usage docs]])
- *New system (17-18 June 2025)*: Cursor replaced fixed quota with *compute-based rate-limit buckets*
- *Ultra*: Only stated as having *"20x the rate limits of Pro"* with raw numbers withheld (see [[#ref2][Rate-limits docs]])

*** Where the 500/10,000 Idea Comes From
Because 20 × 500 = 10,000, many users inferred that Ultra's bucket must be "about ten-thousand fast-request equivalents." This arithmetic is handy for intuition, **but it is not an official guarantee**.

| Plan                            | What Cursor Actually Commits To                                            | Where the 500/10,000 Idea Comes From                                                             |
|---------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *Pro (default, 18 June 2025-)*| Unlimited requests gated by two invisible compute buckets (burst + local) | Legacy Pro used to cap at 500 fast requests, so people use that as mental yard-stick             |
| *Ultra (18 June 2025-)*       | Same bucket system, but "*20x the rate limits of Pro*"                  | 20 × the legacy 500 ≈ 10,000 — an *approximation*, not a published quota                        |

*** Bottom Line
- If you stay on new rate-limit Pro, you no longer get a fixed 500-request pot
- Ultra is simply "whatever Pro gets × 20" — Cursor won't say how big that is in requests or tokens
- You can switch back to old 500-request plan under *Dashboard → Advanced Settings*, but then 20× multiplier no longer applies
- The "500 vs 10,000" phrasing is community shorthand, **not official Cursor documentation**

** What Happens When You Hit the Limit?

| Action                                          | Result                                                                                                                                            |
|-------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Keep sending requests                           | HTTP 429 / "Rate-limit reached" message; request *not* executed, no usage-based charge unless setting enabled                                   |
| Toggle "Enable usage-based pricing"            | Next request succeeds and billed per-model at standard API + ~20% margin                                                                        |
| Wait a few hours                                | Local bucket refills; resume without extra charges                                                                                               |
| Upgrade to Ultra                                | Buckets ~20x larger; no user has reported draining them yet                                                                                      |

** Early User Testing & Community Feedback

| Thread (18 June 2025 unless noted)           | Plan/Model      | Observed Behaviour                                                                 | Reference |
|-----------------------------------------------+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------|
| "I don't really get ULTRA Plan"              | Pro vs Ultra    | One user hit local limit after ~2h background-agent work; others ran 3h no limit | [[#ref3][ref3]]    |
| "We've hit a rate limit with Anthropic"      | Pro, Sonnet 3.5 | Day-long coding loop hit limit; switching model or waiting 3h fixed it            | [[#ref5][ref5]]    |
| "User-provided rate limit exceeded"          | Pro custom key  | Bursty agent exceeded per-minute cap; adding 1-2s delay solved it                 | [[#ref6][ref6]]    |
| "Bad Usage Reporting on 3rd-Party Extension" | Pro             | Users ask Cursor to show clearer "429 vs billable" indicator                      | [[#ref7][ref7]]    |

*Note*: No Ultra user has yet posted a full "I exhausted the bucket" story, suggesting the 20x headroom is currently holding.

** Practical Tips

1. *Watch for the 429 banner* – as long as visible, new calls won't run or accrue charges
2. *Burst wisely* – large prompts or Max mode consume burst budget quickly; spacing requests or using cheaper models stretches it
3. *Decide between Ultra and pay-as-you-go* – if regularly enabling usage billing on Pro and spending >$200/month, Ultra is simpler, cost-capped choice
4. *Transparency is improving* – Cursor staff note Rate-Limits doc will keep expanding over next few days

* Is On New Pricing Model Status API

Check if user is on new pricing model:

#+begin_src sh :exports both :wrap src json :results raw replace
curl 'https://www.cursor.com/api/dashboard/is-on-new-pricing' \
  --data-raw '{}'
#+end_src

#+results:
#+begin_src json
{"isOnNewPricing":true}
#+end_src
